                    Our Virtual Healthcare for Rural Ghana initiative aims to bridge the healthcare gap
                     by providing accessible, affordable, and efficient medical services to underserved 
                     communities. Through telemedicine, mobile health applications, and remote consultations,
                      patients can connect with doctors, receive diagnoses, and access essential health information
                       without the need for long-distance travel and queues in OPDs.

                        Healthcare is divided into two major areas: Medical Care and Surgical Care, both playing a crucial 
                        role in diagnosing, treating, and managing various health conditions. Surgical care involves 
                        medical procedures that require operations to treat diseases, injuries, or physical conditions.
